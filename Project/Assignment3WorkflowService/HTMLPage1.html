    <h1>Connor Weese Assignment 3 User Manual</h1>
    <p><br />I created a web service to get the estimated yearly percentage of sunshine for a given city and state. The application uses this service, along with the Encryption/Decryption service from the ASU repository.</p>
    <p>The interface is fairly simple, only one text box for you to input a city and a state seperated by a comma and a space (e.g. Phoenix, Arizona), along with three buttons.</p>
    <p>The Encryption/Decryption service will encrypt/decrypt the result you get back from the Sunshine service</p>
    <p>You can test my software by running the Windows Forms App and putting in a city/state combo, it will only work for certain cities and states because the data I pull from an external website only has so many data entries.</p>
    <p>You can go to this site to see exactly which ones you can test: https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-sunshine-by-city.php</p>
    <p>Here is test 1, the input is: Phoenix, Arizona</p>

    <p>Here is test 2, the input is: Dallas, Texas</p>
